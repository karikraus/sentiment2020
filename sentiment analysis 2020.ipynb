    "To download this github notebook and upload it to your owm Jupyter installation on your machine, click on \"Raw\" on the righthand side of the github page. Then from your browser menu choose \"Select All\" and then \"Copy\" (depending on what browser you're using, these menu options might appear under \"Edit\" or somewhere else). Once you've copied the contents in the \"Raw\" tab, paste them into a text editor and save the file as a .ipynb file (you can name the file anything you want, but be sure to use that extension). From there you can open Jupyter notebook on your machine and click \"Upload\" on the top right side from the Jupyter main page. Navigate to your Download directory or wherever the new .ipynb file is stored on your hard drive and select it for upload so that it resides in the same directory as your other Jupyter notebooks. You can then click on the new notebook to open it and begin to run the code and play with it. (Note: you may have to refresh your main Jupyter page once you've uploaded in order to see the new notebook in your list of .ipynb files).\n",

    "\n",
    "The first thing you'll need to do is install several Python packages: TextBlob, Pandas (optional), Matplotlib(optional), and NLTK(optional) (You only need to install the optional packages if you want to try producing a graph or experiment with other, more sophisticated sentiment analyzers). This could end up being nearly effortless, taking you all of two minutes, or a deep descent into the abyss. Fortunately you can use one of my interactive Jupyter notebooks online if you encounter technical problems. Ideally, however, you want your own installation on your own machine. Here are instructions:\n",

    "EASIEST METHOD: \n",
    "Textblob: in a new JUPYTER notebook, type and execute the following code:  \n",

    "If you want to run the code on The Yellow Wallpaper or Wuthering Heights: Download (or upload) a copy of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" to the proper directory on your computer. To obtain a copy of these novels, point your browser to Project Gutenberg and select the \"plain text UTF 8\" format: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/768 and https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1952 For instructions about how to save the novel in your text editor and upload it to Jupyter Notebook, head over to the Google Doc I created with instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RKNT6nNF3zXobwF7-YiSsHZ2L4A1lgPAhivL6R5RLHs/edit?usp=sharing\n",

The rest of the code in this notebook should now work.If you're working directly from my online interactive notebook, you don't need to worry about any of the installations (either TextBlob Matplotlib, Pandas, NLTK, or the two novels). You can just start executing and typing code. If you get an automated message or prompt from the system to type in one or two additional lines of code for TextBlob to work in my online notebook, simply enter the relevant commands. \n",

    "Note: you can also upload your own texts to experiment with in my online Notebook if you're not working with your own installation. You'll want to use the \"Upload\" button.

The subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.\" In terms of the polarity value that TextBlob returns for a given sentence, -1 is the most negative score and 1 is the most positive.

Then try writing the saddest, most heartbreaking, miserable, and wretched sentence you can (rant against COVID-19 if that helps; or if reality is too painful to address right now, transcribe a sentence from a favorite tearjerker of a novel or poem). Finally, try a Goldlilocks sentence that is right in the middle. See if through this method you can begin to get a feel for what the range of polarity scores mean. Do a similar exercise for testing subjectivity. You might try writing sentences with unicorns and mythological creatures versus empirical fact-based sentences. Again, the goal is to begin to internalize what the different percentages mean."
